I am using Django's built in authorization for signup and login: The html is boilerplate and customizable. The current structure of the template directory is alot like what Django expects it to be i.e the registration directory is what Django looks for, and the base.html is a kind of wrapper that saves time. 

Urls: accounts/signup, accounts/login, /,
